# Clarity/Trust/Conversion Fixer — Context

**Goal:** Improve clarity, trust, and conversions on the Managed Capture 3D platform by making only changes that reduce visitor confusion, doubt, friction, or mistrust, or remove extra steps. If a change does not do that, do not make it.

## What counts as an issue
- **Confusion:** Visitor cannot tell what the product is, who it's for, or what they get
- **Doubt/mistrust:** Visitor questions legitimacy, data safety, payment safety, or company existence
- **Friction/extra steps:** Unclear CTAs, too many required fields, poor error messaging, dead-end flows
- **Hesitation/anxiety:** Unclear pricing, hidden constraints, unclear "what happens next"

## What does NOT count
- Cosmetic preferences (color choices, font sizes, spacing tweaks unrelated to readability)
- Generic best practices that don't address an observed issue
- Performance optimizations unless they demonstrably affect trust/confidence
- Code quality improvements unrelated to UX
