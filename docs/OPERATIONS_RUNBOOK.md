## Incident Response

### P1: Site Down (All Users Affected)

**Detection:**
- Uptime monitoring alerts (if configured)
- Slack notifications from incident bot
- User reports in support channel

**Immediate Actions (First 5 minutes):**

1. **Verify the Issue**
   ```bash
   # Check site is actually down
   curl -I https://your-domain.netlify.app
   # Should return 200 OK if working

   # Check DNS resolution
   nslookup your-domain.netlify.app
   ```

2. **Check Status Pages**
   - Netlify Status: https://www.netlify.com/status
   - Supabase Status: https://status.supabase.com
   - Is there a known incident?

3. **Post Initial Update**
   - Post to #incidents: "Investigating [Issue Description]"
   - Start incident clock

4. **Gather Logs**
   ```
   Netlify Dashboard:
   → Deploys → Latest deploy
   → Check "Deploy log"

   Supabase Dashboard:
   → Logs → All logs
   → Check for errors
   ```

**Troubleshooting (5-15 minutes):**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| 502/503 Error | Build failing | Check build log, fix error, redeploy |
| Site loads but blank | JS error | Check console, verify Supabase URL |
| Login fails (401) | Auth config | Verify env vars, test Supabase directly |
| Database queries fail (403) | RLS policy | Check user org membership, RLS rules |
| Very slow loads | Network/DB | Check Supabase status, monitor queries |

**Recovery Options:**

1. **If Recent Deploy Caused Issue:**
   ```
   Netlify Dashboard:
   → Deploys
   → Find previous successful deploy
   → Click "Publish deploy"
   ```

2. **If Build is Broken:**
   ```bash
   # Fix code locally
   git fix-your-issue
   git push origin main
   # Netlify auto-deploys
   ```

3. **If Database is Down:**
   - Wait for Supabase to recover
   - Notify users: "Database maintenance in progress"
   - Check https://status.supabase.com for updates

**Post-Incident (After Recovery):**

1. **Verify Everything Works**
   - [ ] Site loads
   - [ ] Login works
   - [ ] Can see projects
   - [ ] No console errors
   - [ ] API calls succeed

2. **Post Summary**
   ```
   #incidents:
   [RESOLVED] Issue description
   Duration: X minutes
   Impact: [Number] users affected
   Root cause: [Brief explanation]
   Resolution: [What we did]
   Prevention: [How to avoid next time]
   ```

3. **Schedule Incident Review**
   - Team meeting within 24 hours
   - Document in wiki/runbook
   - Update this runbook if needed

---

### P2: High Error Rate / Degraded Performance

**Detection:**
- Error rate > 5% in logs
- Response time > 3 seconds
- Supabase connection pool exhausted
- Memory usage > 80%

**Response (Within 1 hour):**

1. **Identify the Issue**
   ```
   Netlify Analytics:
   → Deployments section
   → Look for errors/slowness spike

   Supabase Logs:
   → Look for query timeouts
   → Check connection pool status
   → Monitor database load
   ```

2. **Temporary Mitigations**
   - Increase query timeout (if configurable)
   - Clear CDN cache (Netlify → Deploy settings)
   - Restart functions (if applicable)

3. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Check for recently deployed changes
   - Monitor database query performance
   - Check for N+1 query problems
   - Review error logs for patterns

4. **Resolution**
   - Deploy hotfix if code issue
   - Optimize query if database issue
   - Scale resources if capacity issue

---

### P3: Authentication Issues

**Symptom:** Users report login failures

**Common Causes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Invalid credentials" | Wrong email/password | Verify user exists in Supabase Auth |
| "User profile not found" | No user_profiles record | Create profile record |
| 403 Forbidden | RLS policy denying access | Check user_org_memberships |
| "No active session" | Token expired | User needs to log in again |

**Investigation:**

1. **Check User Exists**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard:
   → Authentication → Users
   → Search for user email
   → Verify user status = "confirmed"
   ```

2. **Check User Profile**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard:
   → SQL Editor
   → SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE email = 'user@example.com'
   → Should have: id, email, name, org_id
   ```

3. **Check Organization Membership**
   ```
   SELECT * FROM user_org_memberships
   WHERE user_id = 'user-id'
   AND org_id = 'org-id'
   ```

4. **Test Supabase Auth Directly**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard:
   → SQL Editor
   → Test: SELECT current_user
   ```

**Fix:**

- Missing user_profiles record: Create it
- Missing org_membership: Add user to org
- User not confirmed: Trigger email verification
- RLS policy issue: Review policy logic

### P3: Database Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:**
- Queries taking > 1 second
- Connection pool errors
- Timeout errors

**Investigation:**

1. **Check Supabase Status**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard:
   → Monitoring
   → Check database load
   → Check connection pool usage
   ```

2. **Review Slow Queries**
   ```
   Supabase Dashboard:
   → Logs
   → Filter for slow queries (> 1000ms)
   → Check query plan
   ```

3. **Check for Lock Contention**
   ```
   SELECT pg_sleep(100); -- Test if queries lock
   ```

**Solutions:**

- Add index: `CREATE INDEX ON table(column)`
- Optimize query: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Increase pool size: Supabase settings
- Scale database: Upgrade plan
- Reduce query load: Enable caching

---

### P3: Frontend JavaScript Errors

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows red errors
- Features not working
- Blank page or partial UI

**Investigation:**

1. **Check Console (F12)**
   - Note exact error message
   - Check stack trace
   - Identify affected feature

2. **Reproduce Issue**
   - Try in private/incognito window
   - Try in different browser
   - Check if environment-specific

3. **Check Browser DevTools**
   - Network tab: Any failed requests?
   - Sources tab: Any source map issues?
   - Application tab: Check localStorage

**Common Causes:**

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Cannot read property 'x' of undefined" | Missing data/null check | Update code, deploy hotfix |
| "Module not found" | Build error | Check build log, fix import |
| "CORS error" | Wrong domain/headers | Verify Supabase URL, check CSP |
| "localStorage is undefined" | SSR/build issue | Check browser compatibility |

**Fix:**
1. Identify cause
2. Create fix locally
3. Deploy hotfix: `git push origin main`
4. Verify fix works on prod

## Knowledge Base

### Common Questions

**Q: How do I know if the site is down?**
A: Check these in order:
1. Visit https://your-domain.netlify.app in browser
2. Check #incidents Slack channel
3. Check https://status.supabase.com
4. Check Netlify dashboard

**Q: How often do backups run?**
A: Supabase runs automatic backups daily. Retention is 30 days.

**Q: Can I deploy without going through Netlify?**
A: No. Netlify is the only deployment method. Must push to main branch.

**Q: How do I add a new project/org to database?**
A: Use Supabase SQL Editor or use app's admin panel after login.

**Q: What should I do if I accidentally break something?**
A: Revert the commit: `git revert <hash>` then `git push origin main`

**Q: Where are secrets/API keys stored?**
A: In Netlify environment variables (Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment)

**Q: Can I edit environment variables without redeploying?**
A: No. After changing env vars, trigger a new deploy for changes to take effect.
