  - [ ] /pricing → Pricing page loads
  - [ ] /how-it-works → How it works page loads
  - [ ] /industries/restaurant → Industry template loads

- [ ] **Test authentication page**
  - Visit https://your-site-name.netlify.app/#/app/login
  - Check: Login form displays
  - Check: Demo user quick links show

### Step 3.3: Test Authentication Flow

- [ ] **Test with mock auth** (VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA still true if not changed)
  - Sign in with admin@company.com (any password)
  - Should redirect to portal
  - Portal should load

- [ ] **Verify token storage**

  - Supabase Dashboard → Project name
  - Check "Paused" indicator (should NOT be paused)

- [ ] **Test real Supabase auth**
  - Sign in with real user created in Step 19
  - Example: test@example.com / TestPassword123!
  - Should load portal with real data

- [ ] **Verify RLS policies working**
  - Create a test project as logged-in user
  - Should appear in projects list
  - Other users should NOT see it

### Step 3.5: Performance Check

- [ ] **Check page load performance**
  - DevTools → Network tab
  - Reload page
  - Check: All requests have 200/304 status
  - Check: Page load time < 3 seconds
  - Check: No 404s or failed requests

- [ ] **Check bundle size**

## Phase 4: Configure Additional Services (Optional, 15 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Set Up Monitoring (Optional)

- [ ] **Enable Netlify Analytics** (optional paid feature)
  - Site Settings → Domains → Enable analytics
  - Provides performance insights

- [ ] **Configure Build Notifications** (recommended)
  - Site Settings → Build & deploy → Notifications
  - Add Slack webhook or email
  - Get alerts on failed builds

- [ ] **Set Up Uptime Monitoring** (recommended, external service)
  - Use UptimeRobot, Pingdom, or similar
  - Point to your production domain
  - Alert on downtime

### Step 4.2: Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

**Skip if using Netlify's default domain**

- [ ] **Add custom domain**
  - Site Settings → Domain management
  - Click "Add domain"
  - Enter your domain (e.g., platform.example.com)

- [ ] **Configure DNS**
  - Netlify provides DNS instructions
  - Add to your DNS provider (GoDaddy, Route53, etc.)
  - Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

- [ ] **Enable HTTPS**
  - Netlify auto-enables Let's Encrypt
  - HTTPS active within 10 minutes
  - Verify with lock icon in browser

### Step 4.3: Configure Security Headers (Already Done in netlify.toml)

- [x] **Security headers in netlify.toml**
  - X-Frame-Options: Preventing clickjacking
  - CSP: Preventing XSS attacks
  - CORS: Allowing Supabase requests

- [ ] **Verify headers are being sent**
  ```bash
  curl -I https://your-site-name.netlify.app | grep -E "X-Frame|CSP|X-Content"
  ```

---

## Phase 5: Documentation & Handoff (10 minutes)

### Step 5.1: Document Configuration

- [ ] **Create deployment notes**
  ```markdown
  # Production Deployment

  **Date:** [Today's date]
  **Status:** Live ✅
  **URL:** https://your-site-name.netlify.app
  **Environment Variables:** Set in Netlify dashboard

  **GitHub:** [Your repository URL]

  **What's deployed:**
  - React frontend with dual auth (mock + real)
  - Netlify hosting and CDN
  - Supabase PostgreSQL backend
  - RLS policies for data isolation

  **How to deploy updates:**
  1. Push to main branch
  2. Netlify auto-builds and deploys
  3. Verify at https://your-site-name.netlify.app
  ```

- [ ] **Save critical URLs**
  - [ ] Production site: https://your-site-name.netlify.app
  - [ ] Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site-name
  - [ ] Supabase dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/your-project-id
  - [ ] GitHub repository: [Your repo URL]

- [ ] **Share with team**
  - [ ] Post to #announcements: "Platform live at [URL]"
  - [ ] Share deployment notes in team wiki
  - [ ] Add to team documentation

### Step 5.2: Create Operations Plan

- [ ] **Assign on-call rotation**
  - Who responds to alerts?
  - How are incidents escalated?
  - What's the escalation time?

- [ ] **Schedule maintenance windows**
  - When can we deploy updates?
  - When do backups run?
  - Communication to users?

- [ ] **Plan training session**
  - Review OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md
  - Practice incident response
  - Test rollback procedure

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails on Netlify but succeeds locally

**Solution:**
1. Check build log for exact error
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure package.json lock file is committed
4. Try clearing Netlify cache: Site Settings → Deployments → Clear cache

### Environment variables not taking effect

**Solution:**
1. Verify variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Trigger manual redeploy (not just pushing code)
3. Variables only take effect on new deploy
4. Check build log to confirm env vars were loaded

### Site loads but features don't work

**Solution:**
1. Open DevTools Console (F12)
2. Check for red error messages
3. Check Network tab for failed API calls
4. Verify Supabase credentials are correct
5. Check if Supabase project is paused

### Login fails with 401 Unauthorized

**Solution:**
1. Verify VITE_SUPABASE_URL is correct
2. Verify VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY is complete
3. Test credentials in Supabase dashboard
4. Check Supabase Status page for incidents
5. Verify user exists in Supabase Auth
