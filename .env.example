# ⚠️  CRITICAL: DO NOT put GEMINI_API_KEY here for production!
# The API key must be stored server-side (in Netlify environment variables).
# The frontend DOES NOT need this key; it calls /.netlify/functions/gemini-proxy instead.
#
# Local Development (optional, if testing Gemini integration):
# - You can set this locally for testing, but it will NOT be exposed to the build
# - Vite's define block has been removed to prevent accidental exposure
#
# Netlify Deployment:
# 1. Add GEMINI_API_KEY to your Netlify Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Environment
# 2. Do NOT commit .env.local to source control
# 3. The Netlify Function (netlify/functions/gemini-proxy.ts) will access it securely

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
